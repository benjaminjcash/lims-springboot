# LIMS - Library Inventory Management System  

Class project for *MSSE 674 Service Based Software Development*  

The *Library Inventory Management System (LIMS)* is a project that was proposed by the Boulder Public Library to manage their inventory of literature. The application has two main purposes:  
1. To reduce the number of books that “go missing”, are “stolen”, or are otherwise “unable to be accounted for” when management performs their monthly audit.  
2. To automate the checkout and return process to reduce overhead for on-site staff.  

## To achieve these goals LIMS will include:  

1. a backend inventory tracking system to ensure every book is accounted for at all times
2. a web-based interface that allows the public to check-in and check-out books without any human interaction.
